# Design and Simulation of a Grid-Connected Level 2 Electric Vehicle Charger (Non-PFC Architecture)

Abstract

This paper reports on the design and simulation-based analysis of a grid-connected Level 2 Electric Vehicle (EV) charger for residential and light commercial usage. The proposed charger is interfaced to a single-phase AC utility grid through a non-power-factor-correction (non-PFC) front-end comprising a diode bridge rectifier with passive filtering. The rectified DC is then entered into a DC–DC conversion stage to provide a regulated DC output for EV battery charging. The proposed charger is modeled and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink for studying the electrical and control characteristics of the charger under various operating conditions. Performance metrics like DC output voltage regulation, charging current stability, conversion efficiency, input current distortion characteristic, and load disturbance dynamic response are analyzed. The simulation results show that the proposed charger provides stable DC output with minimal voltage ripple and stable charging currents over varying loads, along with acceptable power factor characteristics to the utility grid without active power factor correction.
